# About

These files are a sample of a single page for a website created at my current job. The public version of this page can be viewed [here](https://www.arrivehotels.com/austin/gallery).  I have included two JS files as well as two SCSS files; the `gallery.js` file is the page view, and the `Filter.js` is a component used within the page. Obviously there are plenty of requires/files missing in this small sample, but I figured these 4 files would suffice for now.
